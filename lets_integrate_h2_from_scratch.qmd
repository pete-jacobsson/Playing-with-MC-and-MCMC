I picked up the binary enthropy function from MacKay's 2003 classic *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*.

The formula for the function looks like this(MacKay 2003: 2): 
$$
H_2(x) = xlog \frac{1}{x} + (1 - x)log \frac{1}{1-x}
$$

What I want to do here is to build an Monte Carlo rejection sampler to integrate the function. However, before getting to building the sampler, lets first write a function for the binary entropy function and
